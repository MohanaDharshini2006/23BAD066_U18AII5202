# Experiment 6: Over-Plotting Reduction Techniques

## Experiment Details
- **Experiment Number:** 6  
- **Title:** Over-Plotting Reduction Techniques  
- **Programming Language:** R  
- **Domain:** Data Visualization / Social Media Analytics  

---

## Objective
To implement and analyze different visualization techniques that reduce over-plotting in large datasets and improve clarity in data representation.

---

## Scenario
A social media analytics company visualizes millions of user interactions to study engagement patterns. Due to the high volume of data, traditional scatter plots suffer from over-plotting, making interpretation difficult. This experiment applies effective techniques to address this issue.

---

## In-Lab Tasks
- Apply alpha blending  
- Implement jittering techniques  
- Use aggregation and binning methods  

---

## Methodology
The following techniques are implemented using R:
- Normal scatter plot to observe over-plotting  
- Alpha blending using transparency  
- Jittering to separate overlapping points  
- Aggregation using binning to represent data density  

---

## Tools and Technologies
- R Programming Language  
- ggplot2  

---

## Dataset
- **File Name:** `7.social_media_interactions.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains user interaction data such as likes, shares, and engagement metrics.

---

## Output
- Visual comparison of normal and improved scatter plots  
- Clear representation of dense regions in large datasets  
- Better understanding of engagement patterns  

---

## Result
Over-plotting reduction techniques significantly improve visualization clarity and help in accurate interpretation of large-scale social media interaction data.

---

## Learning Outcome
- Ability to handle over-plotting in big data visualization  
- Practical understanding of alpha blending, jittering, and binning  
- Improved analytical and visualization skills
